Hi! I'm an example of the magic of Polymer in real time code! 

Come by a give me a try. All you have to do is run node app.js in the Terminal tab and click on the World icon. 

You can find the Polymer HTMLs in the views file and the Polymer components in the bower_components file 

Happy Coding! :D
